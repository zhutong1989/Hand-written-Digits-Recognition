# Hand-written-Digits-Recognition
MNIST Image Classification
This project is about digit recognition task using machine learning techniques.

I tried several feature extraction methods, the performance of using PCA is the best. I implemented Logistic Regression,
SVM, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting on the first 200 PCA of the original pixel values. 

I also implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the raw pictures by using TensorFlow. It improves the test 
accuracy by about 2%.
